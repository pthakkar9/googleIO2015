# googleIO2015

App should be live on https://googleio2015.herokuapp.com/

Purpose of this app is to be ready to find hidden easter egg links to Google I/O 2015 tickets.

Last year these links were in shortened with goo.gl
These links were hidden on bottom of Google developers pages (e.g. https://developer.android.com/, https://developer.chrome.com/ etc), in source code of these pages and as captions inside Google developers' videos on YouTube.
